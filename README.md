For this project, I created two tables: Customers & Orders.

Then, I inserted data values for each of the column parameters of the two tables.

After inserting data, I used queries to select customer information, order totals, order dates, and more. 
I used subqueries to set certain conditions, which allowed me to extract specific intersections of data. 

The most challenging part for this assignment was understanding the final query & subquery of the lesson. We selected every column field in the orders table, then we extracted only the order dates column. 
I'm not sure why we didn't just select order dates initially.
